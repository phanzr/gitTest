 Object-Oriented Programming on PHP  allows developers to group similar tasks into classes. This helps keep code following the tenet "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) and makes it easy to maintain.
the major benefits of DRY programming is that, if a piece of information changes in your program, usually only one change is required to update the code.
